/**
 * Implementation of the blur estimation feature described by Ke, Tang and Jing,
 * and Yeh et al.
 * <p>
 * Basically, this technique estimates the proportion of blurred pixels by
 * thresholding the power-spectrum (magnitude) of the FFT of the image. Results
 * are in the range 0-1. A higher number implies a sharper image.
